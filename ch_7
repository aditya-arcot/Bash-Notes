# Input/Ouput and Command-Line Processing

## I/O redirectors
# cmd1 | cmd2	pipe

# > file	direct stdout to file (same as 1> file)
# < file	take stdin from file (same as 0< file)
# >> file	direct stdout to file, append if already exists
# n> file	direct file descriptor n to file
# n< file	take file descriptor n from file
# n>> file	direct file descriptor n to file, append if already exists

# >| file	force stdout to file even if noclobber is set
#		noclobber prevents shell from overwriting file with > file
# n>| file	force output to file from file descriptor n even if noclobber is set

# <> file	use file as both stdin and stdout
# n<> file	use file as both input and output for file descriptor n

# << label	here-document
#		allows for batch input to programs
#		stop sending input when label is found

# n>&		duplicate stdout to file descriptor n
# n<&		duplicate stdin from dile descriptor n

# n>&m		file descriptor n is made to be copy of output file descriptor
# 		ex: 2>&1 - stderr file descriptor becomes copy of stdout file descriptor, so both go to same place
# n<&m		file descriptor n is made to be copy of input file descriptor

# &> file	direct stdout and stderr to file

# <&-		close stdin
# >&-		close stdout
# n>&-		close output from file descriptor n
# n<&-		close input from file descriptor n

# n>&word	if n not specified, stdout (file descriptor 1) used
# 		if digits in word do not specify file descriptor open for output, redirection error
# 		as special case, n not specified and word does not expand to 1+ digits, stdout and stderr redirected
# n<&word	if word expands to 1+ digits, file descriptor n is made to be copy of that file descriptor
# 		if digits in word do not specify file descriptor open for input, redirection error
#		if word evaluates to -, file descriptor n closed
#		if n not specified, stdin (file descriptor 0) used
# n>&digit-	move file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or stdout (1) if n not specified
# n<&digit-	move file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or stdin (0) if n not specified
# 		digit closed after being duplicated to n


## File descriptors
# integers (starting at 0) that refer to particular streams of data associated with a process
# new process usually has 3
# 	0 - stdin
# 	1 - stdout
# 	2 - stderr
# additional files opened for output or input are assigned from 3 on
